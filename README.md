## Flux Cycles

### Projects API Request Actions

* `fetchAllProjects`
  0. invoked from `ProjectsIndex` `didMount`/`willReceiveProps`
  0. `GET /api/projects` is called.
  0. `receiveAllProjects` is set as the callback.

* `createProject`
  0. invoked from `PUBLISH` button `onClick`
  0. `POST /api/projects` is called.
  0. `receiveSingleProject` is set as the callback.

* `fetchSingleProject`
  0. invoked from `ProjectItem` `didMount`/`willReceiveProps`
  0. `GET /api/project/:id` is called.
  0. `receiveSingleProject` is set as the callback.

* `updateProject`
  0. invoked from `ProjectForm` `onSubmit`
  0. `POST /api/projects` is called.
  0. `receiveSingleProject` is set as the callback.

* `destroyProject`

### Store Listeners

* `ProjectsIndex` component listens to `Project` store.

## SearchSuggestion Cycles

* `fetchSearchSuggestions`
  0. invoked from `Search` `onChange` when there is text
  0. `GET /api/projects` is called with `text` param.
  0. `receiveSearchSuggestions` is set as the callback.

* `receiveSearchSuggestions`
  0. invoked from an API callback.
  0. `SearchSuggestion` store updates `_suggestions` and emits change.

* `removeSearchSuggestions`
  0. invoked from `Search` `onChange` when empty
  0. `SearchSuggestion` store resets `_suggestions` and emits change.
