## Component Hierarchy

**Bolded** components are associated with routes.

* **App**

    * Search
    * ProjectSlide
  * **ProjectItem**
    * ProjectItemNavbar
    * ProjectItemCommentForm
  * **ProjectForm**

## Routes

Definetly need help figuring this out!

* **component:** `App` **path:** `/`
  * **component:** `ProjectsIndex` **path:** index
  * **component:** `ProjectIndexItem` **path:** `project/:projectId`
  * **component:** `ProjectUser` **path:** `project/:userId`
  

## Flux Cycles

### Projects API Request Actions

* `fetchAllProjects`
  0. invoked from `ProjectsIndex` `didMount`/`willReceiveProps`
  0. `GET /api/projects` is called.
  0. `receiveAllProjects` is set as the callback.

* `createProject`
  0. invoked from `PUBLISH` button `onClick`
  0. `POST /api/projects` is called.
  0. `receiveSingleProject` is set as the callback.

* `fetchSingleProject`

  0. `GET /api/project/:id` is called.
  0. `receiveSingleProject` is set as the callback.

* `updateProject`
  0. invoked from `ProjectForm` `onSubmit`
  0. `POST /api/projects` is called.
  0. `receiveSingleProject` is set as the callback.

* `destroyProject`

  0. `ProjectsStore` store updates `_projects[id]` and emits change.

* `removeProjects`
  0. invoked from an API callback.
  0. `ProjectsStore` store removes `_projects[id]` and emits change.

### Store Listeners

* `ProjectsIndex` component listens to `Project` store.
* `ProjectItem` component listens to `Project` store.

## SearchSuggestion Cycles

* `fetchSearchSuggestions`
  0. invoked from `Search` `onChange` when there is text
  0. `GET /api/projects` is called with `text` param.
  0. `receiveSearchSuggestions` is set as the callback.

* `receiveSearchSuggestions`
  0. invoked from an API callback.
  0. `SearchSuggestion` store updates `_suggestions` and emits change.

* `removeSearchSuggestions`
