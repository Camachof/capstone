## Component Hierarchy

**Bolded** components are associated with routes.

(:exclamation: Remember, the bolded components are created by their
associated routes, so the nesting of your bolded components must
_**exactly**_ match the nesting of your routes.)

* **App**
  * ProjectIndex
    * Search
    * ProjectNavbar
    * ProjectSlide
  * **ProjectIndexItem**
    * ProjectIndexItemNavbar
    * ProjectIndexItemCommentForm
  * **ProjectForm**
    * ProjectFormItem
    * ProjectFormItemTextEditor ??





## Routes

* **component:** `App` **path:** `/`
  * **component:** `NotesIndex` **path:** index
  * **component:** `NotesIndex` **path:** `notebooks/:notebookId`
    * **component:** `NoteDetail` **path:** `notes/:noteId`
  * **component:** `NotesIndex` **path:** none
    * **component:** `NoteDetail` **path:** `notes/:noteId`

For Routes that have no `notebookId`, `NotesIndex` will render all
notes.
