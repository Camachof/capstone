    {title: "How to find a break in an invisible dog fence", body: "Step 1\n\nFirst thing to do is make sure that you do indeed have a break. There are a few ways to do this. On my unit, two wires run from the transmitter to the perimeter fence. Disconnect these wires from the transmitter and put the ends of a paper clip or small piece of wire into the jacks where the wires had been connected. If the alarm is silenced, the transmitter is working properly and you have a break. Another way to verify that there is a break is to use an ohmmeter and check the resistance on the disconnected wires. If there is no resistance the wires are continuous and there is not a break, meaning you may have a problem with the transmitter itself.\n\nStep 2 \n\nTake the two wires that you disconnected from the transmitter and connect them to the leads of the RF choke. Then insert the leads of the choke into the jacks on the transmitter where the wires were originally connected. As I understand it, this allows the transmitter to continue sending a signal to the fence even though it is broken.\n\nStep 3\n\nThe fence emits a radio signal that is picked up by a reciever on your dog's collar when it gets in range, causing a warning signal or an electric shock. You should be able to detect this signal in the lower AM range. The signal of my fence was roughly 600 kHz. When tuned to the right frequency, you will hear the signal as you pass the radio over the ground. It may be necessary to turn up the intensity of the signal at the tranmitter, although I didn't have to (there should be a numbered dial somewhere on the transmitter, just remember to turn it back down later so you don't fry fido!).\n\nStep 4\n\nWalk the perimeter while passing the radio antenna over the ground where you suspect the wire to be. You should be able to pick up a clear, definite signal. The video shows me walking the radio back and forth over the line (in reality the signal was much clearer than it sounds, but you can definitely get the idea). When tuned in perfectly, the signal sounded like a rapid tapping/beeping - when tuned close but not right on, the signal caused the static to get louder as the radio passed over the wire. When you find an area where the signal drops out for a few feet, this is likely to be your break. Go slow and check the whole perimeter before you start digging, I found areas that seemed weak but when I eventually found the break it was pretty obvious.\n\nStep 5 \n\nWhen you've located the area where you suspect the break to be you'll need to expose the wire. I used a 3-pronged hand tiller and dragged it perpendicular to the wire, the invisible fence guys used a pick axe. Use whatever you like but be careful that you don't cut or knick the wire in the process.\n\nStep 6\n\nOnce you've found a break, use the radio to check that you have a strong signal on both lines. I actually had two breaks but didn't know it until I found the first break and realized that one of the ends did not have a signal. I continued to dig in the direction of the dead line and found a second break a few feet away. If you have a strong signal on both ends connect them with a piece of wire, disconnect the choke and reconnect the wires from the fence into the transmitter. If the alarm goes off, congratulations, you've found your break!\n\nStep 7\n\nThe final step is connecting the broken ends in a way that is weatherproof and secure. I bought these connectors from the local hardware store, time will tell if they are the best ones or not but you want something that is waterproof and suitable for the temperature range in your climate. This type of connector is filled with silicone to seal the twisted wires. Once you're sure the fence is operating correctly, bury the mended wires and you're done!

After calling the company I was informed that this alarm meant there was a break in the fence, and that I should have them come out as soon as possible - because my dog would surely figure this out in a few days. And hey, for only $100 an hour, they would be happy to help! Long story short, they tried for an hour then told me the yard was too overgrown (half the yard is wooded) and they would have to come back in the fall when everything died back (2 months away). This made me swear that I would do it myself - but after digging up over 100 feet of wire and driving myself crazy for a few days, I had not found the break. Then I found this strategy on the internet that cost me under $20 and worked like a charm. Hopefully this makes it clear for everyone else and saves you some money and frustration. Good luck!

    {title: "How to Break Up", body: "Step 1 \n\nYour partner's going to want to know what the heck is going on. It's best for both of you if you are prepared to face this question.\n\nIf you're mad, that's one thing. Don't act on it just yet. It's really important that you take some time and consider exactly what it is that's made you mad.\n\nIf you're sad, or feeling some kind of hard-to-explain or unclear (even to you) emotion, you need to identify that too. It might not seem easy (perhaps you've been avoiding it?), but now's the time.\n\nIs there someone else? Has another prospect drawn your eye? Have you already acted on these feelings? Whether or not you have, you need to get to the bottom of why this is happening - why you're attracted to someone else right now. Working this out now will help prevent a long series of making the same mistakes in the future.\n\nGet some paper. Write down everything you're feeling.\n\nIt doesn't have to make sense. It doesn't need punctuation or good spelling or even legible handwriting. This is for your eyes only!\n\nWhile you're writing, ask yourself some questions:\n\nDoes the relationship make you feel good?\nDoes the relationship allow you to evolve and grow in your own directions?\nDoes your partner accept you exactly the way you are?\nDo you communicate well?\nCan you resolve conflicts together?\nDo you feel safe?\nWhat do you feel you're missing?\n\nStep 2 \n\nNow that you have your list, you have some \"actionable\" items! Before you take the leap into singledom, see what you can do to resolve some of these issues.\n\nYou have nothing to lose and everything to gain by engaging in an open and honest discussion with your partner.\n\nAgh. But how?!? \n\nTry telling your partner you haven't been feeling like the relationship is everything it could be. Talk about the things you discovered while you were writing.\n\nDon't make accusations. What you feel comes from within you.Example: replace \"You make me feel. . . \" with \"I feel. . . \"\nDiscuss alternatives to your current ways of operating that might make you feel more fulfilled.\nIf you feel unappreciated or unaccepted, voice your concerns. It could be that your partner really digs you, but doesn't express it in the way you're accustomed to recognizing it!\n\nWhatever results from this discussion is your doorway to what happens next.\n\nYou may find that talking about it without being afraid of hurting each other's feelings is all you needed to set you on the right path!\n\nDepending on the depth of your relationship, you may consider speaking with a counselor, either as an individual, or as a couple. \n\nMany couples see a counselor when they are uncertain whether or not to continue on with their relationship, long before they've even reached the stage of breaking up! Therapy is a safe place to explore concerns you're both having. It's common to find that you're both able to understand each other more deeply when you have a professional moderating!\n\nWhatever you decide to do, this conversation should make that clear to you both, making the ensuing steps infinitely easier on you both.\n\nYou and your partner both deserve to have this conversation.\n\nStep 3\n\nIf you've decided it is indeed time to break up, you may want to take a few days to yourself. This will allow you to gain some emotional distance, helping to ensure that the break-up won't turn ugly.\n\nUse this time to plan how you're going to handle the break-up.\n\nConsider what you'll say, and envision some possible reactions so you're prepared a little better to handle the situation without losing control.\n\nThis time away should also be a warning sign to your partner.\n\nHopefully they'll realize you're retreating, and considering the conversation you've already had by now, they'll be using this time to emotionally prepare themselves for what's to come.\n\nStep 4\n\nDecide how much time you're willing to spend breaking up.\n\nIt's probably going to go on longer than you'd like. But by now, you know what you want, so don't let it drag on. The time you spend should be proportional to how long you've been together and the intensity of the relationship.\n\nBe respectful of how much time your partner needs to digest this information, but make sure you prepare an exit strategy. It's ok to say, \"I've said everything I can, and I can't talk about this more right now.\" \n\nPrepare your discussion as much as you can.\n\nIt's obviously not going to go exactly as you plan, no matter how many contingencies you anticipate. Help yourself by remaining honest and staying on topic.\n\nStick to the truth\nAvoid statements like \"always\" or \"never\"\nDon't nitpick\nBe respectful, but don't mince your words to spare your partner's feelings\nBe prepared for a strong emotional response\nBe sober\n\nStep 5\n\nYou must do this in person.\n\nIn no way are you allowed to break up via text, chat, facebook status, email, or letter.\n\nYou're not allowed to just disappear either. The lack of closure can be psychologically damaging to you both. \n\nChoose somewhere safe.\n\nIf there's any chance whatsoever of this discussion becoming physical, or if you and your partner are prone to screaming fights, choose a public venue for this event to keep you both on your best behavior. \n\nIf this isn't case, choose a place where your partner can be free to express his/her emotions. You might wish to avoid this, but they deserve the ability to do this in front of you. \n\nMake sure it's a place you can walk away from\n\nIf you do it at your house, they choose when to leave. Baaaaad idea.\n\nIf you live together. . . ouch. This is hard. Be prepared to leave and stay somewhere else for a while. If you don't have the time to pack and move entirely before having this conversation, be prepared to stay away long enough for the heat to die down. Then find a time when your partner is away and finish the job.\n\nStep 6\n\n\nThis is anything but easy. But you're prepared! You know your reasons, and you know what to expect.\n\nStay calm.\n\n\"We need to talk\" is a completely acceptable lead-in. It's a clear signal that this is serious, and something unpleasant is going to follow. \n\nSit your partner down and let them know that it's time to end the relationship. Don't mince words. Let them know that you think you've both done everything that you can, and he/she is a great person, but this is just not the right \"fit.\"\n\nHopefully you know your partner and the state of the relationship well enough to know what to expect. You might, however, be surprised. Try to stay calm, no matter what happens.\n\nExpect a reaction.\n\nThis include (but not be limited to!):\n\nQuestioning - He or she will want to know why, and what they could have done to prevent the break-up. Answer as honestly as possible.\nCrying - The other person will likely be upset. You can comfort him or her, but don't be manipulated into changing your mind!\nBargaining or begging - Your partner may offer to change, or do whatever you want to preserve the relationship. Know that if the person hasn't been able to change in the past, they won't be able to now.\nLashing out - The other person may be hurting now, and may want you to hurt too. Whether it's as simple as \"You'll never find anyone as good as me,\" or as scary as \"If I can't have you, no one can,\" he or she is usually just trying to make themselves feel better by hurting you. However, threats of physical harm are serious, and should not be ignored.\nArguing - He or she may dispute anything you've said at this point, even debating examples you've used in your reasons for breaking up. Don't get dragged into a fight. Don't split hairs - it doesn't matter now. Let your partner know that arguing isn't going to change your mind.\n\nIf you can't avoid a fight, be ready to leave, acknowledging to your partner that you will continue this discussion when you both have calmed down.\n\nStep 7\n\nEnding a relationship is a humbling experience.\n\nMost of us don't handle rejection well.\n\nSometimes our reactions can be a surprise even to ourselves. Don't allow yourself to be taken in by the other person's reactions.\n\nAlways be understanding\nSay that you are sorry things didn't work out\nBe confident, even if you haven't been so in the relationship in the past\nControl your emotions to send a clear signal\nIf you do still love the person, you can let them know how important they are to you and that you want them to stay in your life. Make it clear that this will not be in a romantic way.\n\nMake it stick.\n\nBe clear that the romantic relationship is over. If you don't want to have a platonic relationship with them, be clear about that too. \n\nThe sooner the other person can understand that you are not going to change their mind, the sooner they'll be able to get over your sorry a** begin the healing.\n\nStep 8 \n\nBoth you and the other person will now need time to digest the break-up. Your lives are now changed. Give it time! You both need time away from each other to get on with your lives.\n\nDon't call. Don't text. Don't email. Don't be where they're going to be.\n\nThis \"no contact\" rule is essential to the healing process. But sometimes the urge to make contact can be too hard to resist! \n\nGet your friends to help you. If you're going out for drinks, give them your cell.\nIf you find yourself up late at night writing an email, send it to yourself. You can delete it tomorrow.\nIf the other person is trying to contact you, help them out by not responding.\n\nThough you may be able to be BFF in the future, you'll both need plenty of time and space before you can make that happen.\n\nThe sooner you accept this, the sooner you can move on! \n\nStep 9\n\nSo. That sucked. But you handled it with grace and dignity! Good for you.\n\nA bad relationship is a stalemate. It's not only stopping you both from living a fulfilling life, it can also harm your self-esteem and confidence.\n\nRemember, breaking up is a normal part of life.\n\nIt happens to most everyone at some point in their lives. \n\nWe all have heartbreak, but we can survive it.\n\nTake care of yourself now.\n\nEat well, exercise, allow yourself plenty of sleep.\nSpend more time doing things you might not have done otherwise!\nPamper yourself for no reason.\n\nYou've accomplished a painful and arduous task, and you are now one step closer to happiness.", user_id: 2, images: "http://res.cloudinary.com/doilr7vvv/image/upload/v1468197709/ljpcyuhfqebmgxue8yvq.jpg", video_url: "", description: "Breaking up isn't easy, right?

    {title: "How to Break in Nine Ball", body: "Step 1\n\nSince your cue stick is the only item that should ever make contact with the cue ball during a shot, it is imperative that you make sure your cue stick is in top shape prior to playing.\n\nThe top felt piece of the cue stick is called the tip, and is what allows for spin when hitting the cue ball. To ensure proper grip for spin, make sure to brush the tip of the cue stick with chalk prior to playing a game. A spinning motion while carefully pressing down on the chalk normally works best for covering the entire tip, but always check after brushing for any missed spots. Lightly blow on the tip after brushing to remove any stray chalk so that you don’t scuff the table while playing.\n\nWARNING: Do not press hard on the chalk while brushing the tip of your cue stick. You will loosen the adhesive and possibly remove the tip from your cue.\n\nOnce your cue stick is properly chalked, it is time to hit the cue ball.\n\nStep 2\n\nAs said previously, the cue ball is the only billiards ball that should be manipulated directly by the player. The following instructions for hitting a cue ball are explained for right-handers, so if you are left-handed flip all hand and arm positions.\n\nWhen holding a cue stick, your right hand functions as the grip and your left hand the bridge. While your right hand and arm will control speed of shot, your left hand provides support for the cue stick and allows for precision aiming. In the case of a long shot the standard bridge can be used instead of your left hand but the concept still applies.\n\nTo ensure a confident shot, maintain a light firm grip with your right hand near the end of the cue stick. When the stick is gripped properly it should not touch the palm of your hand. As you lean in for your shot your right elbow should be bent to allow for full extension when carrying through your shot.\n\nYour left hand can hold the front end of the cue stick in one of two styles: the open bridge and the closed bridge. The open bridge is used mainly for shots over obstacles, such as a bank or another ball, as it allows for full extension of the fingers. A closed bridge would be used for straight shots closer to the player as it maintains a straighter line with the cue stick. In most cases these styles can be used interchangeably, so pick whichever you prefer.\n\nTo shoot open bridge, place your palm flat on the table. Next, bend your fingers towards your palm so that the angle from your fingertips to your knuckles is about 30 degrees. All of the bending should be from your knuckles so that your fingers and your hand form a triangle with the table. Lift your thumb up so that a “v” shape is formed between your thumb and your palm. The cue stick will rest in this “v”. To adjust the angle of shot, raise or lower your fingers accordingly. Closed bridge is formed by placing the cue in an open bridge and then forming an “o” shape with your pointer finger and the table over the cue. The cue stick should not touch the top of the pointer finger but can brush the sides.\n\nWith this in mind we can move on to controlling spin.\n\nStep 3\n\nA good billiards player will adjust the spin of their shot so that the cue ball will move to a desired location.\n\nDepending on where you hit the cue ball the spin of the ball will change accordingly. Hitting the top of the ball creates forward spin (topspin), causing the ball to continue moving forward after contacting another ball. Hitting the bottom of the ball created backward spin (backspin), causing the ball to move backwards after making contact with another ball. Hitting the center of the cue ball is considered a flat shot and will cause the cue ball to stop wherever it makes contact with another ball.\n\nNOTE: Angling the cue stick up or down prior to hitting will also cause spin, but too forceful of a backspin or flat shot from a high angle can cause the cue ball to jump up off of the table. If used properly this can be a very useful shot but if not can cause an off-of-table foul.\n\nWith this information in mind we can set up the game to start play.\n\nStep 4\n\nNine Ball is slightly different than most billiards games in the way that the rack is set up. Instead of the traditional triangle shape, the balls must be arranged in a diamond with its longer side following the length of the table. As with all traditional racks, the top (the point closest to the other side) must be aligned with the “foot spot”. This will either be marked with a small dot on the table or can be approximated as one quarter of the length of the table.\n\nIn the case of Nine Ball, the player must hit the balls on the table in ascending order, winning the game by pocketing the nine ball. Due to this rule, the 1 ball must always be placed at the top of the diamond closest to the player and the nine ball in the center. All other balls in play may be placed arbitrarily.\n\nA diamond rack is preferred for ease of use, however if only a triangle rack is available use the top two sides to align the top point of the diamond while using your hands to push up the bottom point.\n\nNOTE: The “tighter” you make the rack, or the closer you place the balls to each other, the more responsive your break will be. To make your setup as tight as possible lift the rack straight up without touching the balls in the diamond. Any shifting can cause a “loose rack”, which should be corrected prior to starting.\n\nAfter the rack is set up, it’s time to lag for break.\n\nStep 5\n\n“Lagging for break” is a way to determine who breaks, or starts the game.\n\nEach player will hit the cue ball down the length of the billiards table and bounce it off of the wall, or bank. Your goal is to put the cue ball as close to the bank closest to you without touching, and whoever does so wins the lag. If there is a tie or all players hit the bank, lagging for break is done again. To designate your cue ball’s position on your lag, place your finger on the side of the table until all turns have passed or someone has bettered your shot.\n\nWhen the winner is decided, they will break.\n\nStep 6\n\nBreaking the rack is one of the most important shots in the game, as it can determine an instant win or loss as well as sets initial placement of balls on the table.\n\nAs said before, you must hit the balls in ascending order, and breaking is no exception. If you hit any other ball before the one, miss all of the balls entirely, or sink the cue ball in the pocket on the break it is considered a foul, or scratch, and you lose the game. Therefore it is considered best practice to place the cue ball closest to the center width of the table as it sets a straight line to the 1 ball in the rack.\n\nThere are restrictions on ball placement, however. You may not place the cue ball further than one quarter down the length of the pool table. This, just like racking, will either be designated by a dot on the table known as the “head spot” or two markers down the side of the table. Anywhere within this boundary is allowed, however it is recommended to place the cue ball as close to the edge as possible for the easiest shot.\n\nFor hitting the cue ball, a hard topspin is recommended however a flat shot will work just as well. A harder shot will disperse the balls more evenly across the table, which makes later shots easier during the game.

    {title: "Flores Con Filtros De Café", body: "Step 1\n\nLo primero es doblar los filtros de papel 4 veces. Necesitamos 5 piezas por cada flor que queramos crear. Luego con la tijera cortamos 3 de las 5 piezas por lo menos media pulgada en la parte superior.\n\nStep 2\n\nPara darle color a los pétalos, utilizaremos pintura diluida en agua. Podemos utilizar la pintura que queramos siempre y cuando se pueda diluir. Pichón utilizó acuarelas.\n\nDividiremos el color en 3 envases: cada uno con más agua que el anterior para lograr que nuestra flor vaya degradando en color. Al momento de separar, pondremos los triángulos mas pequeños en los colores más intensos y los restantes en los tonos más claros.\n\nStep 3\n\nEsperamos que las piezas sequen para proceder a cortarlas en las formas que deseemos. Pichón decidió darle a las piezas pequeñas un look triangular y a las más grandes circular.\n\nStep 4\n\nPasamos entonces a cortar la punta de 4 de los triángulos (2 pequeños y los 2 grandes) pero solo un poco. No queremos terminar con un agujero muy grade.\n\nStep 5\n\nProcedemos a unir las piezas al sorbete. Primero utilizamos la pieza que no cortamos como centro de nuestra flor. La uniremos con tape floral, el cual usaremos también para recubrir el sorbete y simular el tallo de la flor.\n\nStep 6\n\nFinalizaremos entonces introduciendo el resto de los triángulos a través del sorbete, desde las piezas pequeñas hasta las piezas grandes. Cuando concluyamos con las piezas, las unimos todas con tape floral y recubrimos completamente el sorbete.\n\nStep 7\n\n¿Qué les parece? ¿Hermoso, no? Atrévanse a utilizar diferentes colores, formas y pinturas. Es un proyecto bien simple que podemos realizar con los más pequeños y es un regalo perfecto para cualquier ocasión.\n\n¿Qué opinan de esta manualidad que nos trae Mr. Pichón el día de hoy?

Repeat the same with the other side (pictures 1-3).\n\n2) Take the nose of the glider and fold it over to create a flat edge. Crease it (pictures 4-5).\n\n3) Slightly unfold the \"nose flap\" to expose two slits. Slightly unfold the \"side flaps\" and insert them into the \"nose flap\" (pictures 6-13). Once both flaps have been inserted into the slits, fully seat them by pushing down and creasing.\n\nStep 5\n\n1) Turn the glider over.\n\n2) Take hold of the edge and fold it inward to create a wing. Crease it. Repeat the step on the other side making sure you fold it the same distance (pictures 2-3)\n\n3) Take the top of your new fold, and fold it over on itself.
