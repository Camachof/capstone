  {title: "How to find a break in an invisible dog fence", body: "Step 1\n\nFirst thing to do is make sure that you do indeed have a break. There are a few ways to do this. On my unit, two wires run from the transmitter to the perimeter fence. Disconnect these wires from the transmitter and put the ends of a paper clip or small piece of wire into the jacks where the wires had been connected. If the alarm is silenced, the transmitter is working properly and you have a break. Another way to verify that there is a break is to use an ohmmeter and check the resistance on the disconnected wires. If there is no resistance the wires are continuous and there is not a break, meaning you may have a problem with the transmitter itself.\n\nStep 2 \n\nTake the two wires that you disconnected from the transmitter and connect them to the leads of the RF choke. Then insert the leads of the choke into the jacks on the transmitter where the wires were originally connected. As I understand it, this allows the transmitter to continue sending a signal to the fence even though it is broken.\n\nStep 3\n\nThe fence emits a radio signal that is picked up by a reciever on your dog's collar when it gets in range, causing a warning signal or an electric shock. You should be able to detect this signal in the lower AM range. The signal of my fence was roughly 600 kHz. When tuned to the right frequency, you will hear the signal as you pass the radio over the ground. It may be necessary to turn up the intensity of the signal at the tranmitter, although I didn't have to (there should be a numbered dial somewhere on the transmitter, just remember to turn it back down later so you don't fry fido!).\n\nStep 4\n\nWalk the perimeter while passing the radio antenna over the ground where you suspect the wire to be. You should be able to pick up a clear, definite signal. The video shows me walking the radio back and forth over the line (in reality the signal was much clearer than it sounds, but you can definitely get the idea). When tuned in perfectly, the signal sounded like a rapid tapping/beeping - when tuned close but not right on, the signal caused the static to get louder as the radio passed over the wire. When you find an area where the signal drops out for a few feet, this is likely to be your break. Go slow and check the whole perimeter before you start digging, I found areas that seemed weak but when I eventually found the break it was pretty obvious.\n\nStep 5 \n\nWhen you've located the area where you suspect the break to be you'll need to expose the wire. I used a 3-pronged hand tiller and dragged it perpendicular to the wire, the invisible fence guys used a pick axe. Use whatever you like but be careful that you don't cut or knick the wire in the process.\n\nStep 6\n\nOnce you've found a break, use the radio to check that you have a strong signal on both lines. I actually had two breaks but didn't know it until I found the first break and realized that one of the ends did not have a signal. I continued to dig in the direction of the dead line and found a second break a few feet away. If you have a strong signal on both ends connect them with a piece of wire, disconnect the choke and reconnect the wires from the fence into the transmitter. If the alarm goes off, congratulations, you've found your break!\n\nStep 7\n\nThe final step is connecting the broken ends in a way that is weatherproof and secure. I bought these connectors from the local hardware store, time will tell if they are the best ones or not but you want something that is waterproof and suitable for the temperature range in your climate. This type of connector is filled with silicone to seal the twisted wires. Once you're sure the fence is operating correctly, bury the mended wires and you're done!

After calling the company I was informed that this alarm meant there was a break in the fence, and that I should have them come out as soon as possible - because my dog would surely figure this out in a few days. And hey, for only $100 an hour, they would be happy to help! Long story short, they tried for an hour then told me the yard was too overgrown (half the yard is wooded) and they would have to come back in the fall when everything died back (2 months away). This made me swear that I would do it myself - but after digging up over 100 feet of wire and driving myself crazy for a few days, I had not found the break. Then I found this strategy on the internet that cost me under $20 and worked like a charm. Hopefully this makes it clear for everyone else and saves you some money and frustration. Good luck!

  {title: "How to Break Up", body: "Step 1 \n\nYour partner's going to want to know what the heck is going on. It's best for both of you if you are prepared to face this question.\n\nIf you're mad, that's one thing. Don't act on it just yet. It's really important that you take some time and consider exactly what it is that's made you mad.\n\nIf you're sad, or feeling some kind of hard-to-explain or unclear (even to you) emotion, you need to identify that too. It might not seem easy (perhaps you've been avoiding it?), but now's the time.\n\nIs there someone else? Has another prospect drawn your eye? Have you already acted on these feelings? Whether or not you have, you need to get to the bottom of why this is happening - why you're attracted to someone else right now. Working this out now will help prevent a long series of making the same mistakes in the future.\n\nGet some paper. Write down everything you're feeling.\n\nIt doesn't have to make sense. It doesn't need punctuation or good spelling or even legible handwriting. This is for your eyes only!\n\nWhile you're writing, ask yourself some questions:\n\nDoes the relationship make you feel good?\nDoes the relationship allow you to evolve and grow in your own directions?\nDoes your partner accept you exactly the way you are?\nDo you communicate well?\nCan you resolve conflicts together?\nDo you feel safe?\nWhat do you feel you're missing?\n\nStep 2 \n\nNow that you have your list, you have some \"actionable\" items! Before you take the leap into singledom, see what you can do to resolve some of these issues.\n\nYou have nothing to lose and everything to gain by engaging in an open and honest discussion with your partner.\n\nAgh. But how?!? \n\nTry telling your partner you haven't been feeling like the relationship is everything it could be. Talk about the things you discovered while you were writing.\n\nDon't make accusations. What you feel comes from within you.Example: replace \"You make me feel. . . \" with \"I feel. . . \"\nDiscuss alternatives to your current ways of operating that might make you feel more fulfilled.\nIf you feel unappreciated or unaccepted, voice your concerns. It could be that your partner really digs you, but doesn't express it in the way you're accustomed to recognizing it!\n\nWhatever results from this discussion is your doorway to what happens next.\n\nYou may find that talking about it without being afraid of hurting each other's feelings is all you needed to set you on the right path!\n\nDepending on the depth of your relationship, you may consider speaking with a counselor, either as an individual, or as a couple. \n\nMany couples see a counselor when they are uncertain whether or not to continue on with their relationship, long before they've even reached the stage of breaking up! Therapy is a safe place to explore concerns you're both having. It's common to find that you're both able to understand each other more deeply when you have a professional moderating!\n\nWhatever you decide to do, this conversation should make that clear to you both, making the ensuing steps infinitely easier on you both.\n\nYou and your partner both deserve to have this conversation.\n\nStep 3\n\nIf you've decided it is indeed time to break up, you may want to take a few days to yourself. This will allow you to gain some emotional distance, helping to ensure that the break-up won't turn ugly.\n\nUse this time to plan how you're going to handle the break-up.\n\nConsider what you'll say, and envision some possible reactions so you're prepared a little better to handle the situation without losing control.\n\nThis time away should also be a warning sign to your partner.\n\nHopefully they'll realize you're retreating, and considering the conversation you've already had by now, they'll be using this time to emotionally prepare themselves for what's to come.\n\nStep 4\n\nDecide how much time you're willing to spend breaking up.\n\nIt's probably going to go on longer than you'd like. But by now, you know what you want, so don't let it drag on. The time you spend should be proportional to how long you've been together and the intensity of the relationship.\n\nBe respectful of how much time your partner needs to digest this information, but make sure you prepare an exit strategy. It's ok to say, \"I've said everything I can, and I can't talk about this more right now.\" \n\nPrepare your discussion as much as you can.\n\nIt's obviously not going to go exactly as you plan, no matter how many contingencies you anticipate. Help yourself by remaining honest and staying on topic.\n\nStick to the truth\nAvoid statements like \"always\" or \"never\"\nDon't nitpick\nBe respectful, but don't mince your words to spare your partner's feelings\nBe prepared for a strong emotional response\nBe sober\n\nStep 5\n\nYou must do this in person.\n\nIn no way are you allowed to break up via text, chat, facebook status, email, or letter.\n\nYou're not allowed to just disappear either. The lack of closure can be psychologically damaging to you both. \n\nChoose somewhere safe.\n\nIf there's any chance whatsoever of this discussion becoming physical, or if you and your partner are prone to screaming fights, choose a public venue for this event to keep you both on your best behavior. \n\nIf this isn't case, choose a place where your partner can be free to express his/her emotions. You might wish to avoid this, but they deserve the ability to do this in front of you. \n\nMake sure it's a place you can walk away from\n\nIf you do it at your house, they choose when to leave. Baaaaad idea.\n\nIf you live together. . . ouch. This is hard. Be prepared to leave and stay somewhere else for a while. If you don't have the time to pack and move entirely before having this conversation, be prepared to stay away long enough for the heat to die down. Then find a time when your partner is away and finish the job.\n\nStep 6\n\n\nThis is anything but easy. But you're prepared! You know your reasons, and you know what to expect.\n\nStay calm.\n\n\"We need to talk\" is a completely acceptable lead-in. It's a clear signal that this is serious, and something unpleasant is going to follow. \n\nSit your partner down and let them know that it's time to end the relationship. Don't mince words. Let them know that you think you've both done everything that you can, and he/she is a great person, but this is just not the right \"fit.\"\n\nHopefully you know your partner and the state of the relationship well enough to know what to expect. You might, however, be surprised. Try to stay calm, no matter what happens.\n\nExpect a reaction.\n\nThis include (but not be limited to!):\n\nQuestioning - He or she will want to know why, and what they could have done to prevent the break-up. Answer as honestly as possible.\nCrying - The other person will likely be upset. You can comfort him or her, but don't be manipulated into changing your mind!\nBargaining or begging - Your partner may offer to change, or do whatever you want to preserve the relationship. Know that if the person hasn't been able to change in the past, they won't be able to now.\nLashing out - The other person may be hurting now, and may want you to hurt too. Whether it's as simple as \"You'll never find anyone as good as me,\" or as scary as \"If I can't have you, no one can,\" he or she is usually just trying to make themselves feel better by hurting you. However, threats of physical harm are serious, and should not be ignored.\nArguing - He or she may dispute anything you've said at this point, even debating examples you've used in your reasons for breaking up. Don't get dragged into a fight. Don't split hairs - it doesn't matter now. Let your partner know that arguing isn't going to change your mind.\n\nIf you can't avoid a fight, be ready to leave, acknowledging to your partner that you will continue this discussion when you both have calmed down.\n\nStep 7\n\nEnding a relationship is a humbling experience.\n\nMost of us don't handle rejection well.\n\nSometimes our reactions can be a surprise even to ourselves. Don't allow yourself to be taken in by the other person's reactions.\n\nAlways be understanding\nSay that you are sorry things didn't work out\nBe confident, even if you haven't been so in the relationship in the past\nControl your emotions to send a clear signal\nIf you do still love the person, you can let them know how important they are to you and that you want them to stay in your life. Make it clear that this will not be in a romantic way.\n\nMake it stick.\n\nBe clear that the romantic relationship is over. If you don't want to have a platonic relationship with them, be clear about that too. \n\nThe sooner the other person can understand that you are not going to change their mind, the sooner they'll be able to get over your sorry a** begin the healing.\n\nStep 8 \n\nBoth you and the other person will now need time to digest the break-up. Your lives are now changed. Give it time! You both need time away from each other to get on with your lives.\n\nDon't call. Don't text. Don't email. Don't be where they're going to be.\n\nThis \"no contact\" rule is essential to the healing process. But sometimes the urge to make contact can be too hard to resist! \n\nGet your friends to help you. If you're going out for drinks, give them your cell.\nIf you find yourself up late at night writing an email, send it to yourself. You can delete it tomorrow.\nIf the other person is trying to contact you, help them out by not responding.\n\nThough you may be able to be BFF in the future, you'll both need plenty of time and space before you can make that happen.\n\nThe sooner you accept this, the sooner you can move on! \n\nStep 9\n\nSo. That sucked. But you handled it with grace and dignity! Good for you.\n\nA bad relationship is a stalemate. It's not only stopping you both from living a fulfilling life, it can also harm your self-esteem and confidence.\n\nRemember, breaking up is a normal part of life.\n\nIt happens to most everyone at some point in their lives. \n\nWe all have heartbreak, but we can survive it.\n\nTake care of yourself now.\n\nEat well, exercise, allow yourself plenty of sleep.\nSpend more time doing things you might not have done otherwise!\nPamper yourself for no reason.\n\nYou've accomplished a painful and arduous task, and you are now one step closer to happiness.", user_id: 2, images: "http://res.cloudinary.com/doilr7vvv/image/upload/v1468197709/ljpcyuhfqebmgxue8yvq.jpg", video_url: "", description: "Breaking up isn't easy, right?

  {title: "How to Break in Nine Ball", body: "Step 1\n\nSince your cue stick is the only item that should ever make contact with the cue ball during a shot, it is imperative that you make sure your cue stick is in top shape prior to playing.\n\nThe top felt piece of the cue stick is called the tip, and is what allows for spin when hitting the cue ball. To ensure proper grip for spin, make sure to brush the tip of the cue stick with chalk prior to playing a game. A spinning motion while carefully pressing down on the chalk normally works best for covering the entire tip, but always check after brushing for any missed spots. Lightly blow on the tip after brushing to remove any stray chalk so that you don’t scuff the table while playing.\n\nWARNING: Do not press hard on the chalk while brushing the tip of your cue stick. You will loosen the adhesive and possibly remove the tip from your cue.\n\nOnce your cue stick is properly chalked, it is time to hit the cue ball.\n\nStep 2\n\nAs said previously, the cue ball is the only billiards ball that should be manipulated directly by the player. The following instructions for hitting a cue ball are explained for right-handers, so if you are left-handed flip all hand and arm positions.\n\nWhen holding a cue stick, your right hand functions as the grip and your left hand the bridge. While your right hand and arm will control speed of shot, your left hand provides support for the cue stick and allows for precision aiming. In the case of a long shot the standard bridge can be used instead of your left hand but the concept still applies.\n\nTo ensure a confident shot, maintain a light firm grip with your right hand near the end of the cue stick. When the stick is gripped properly it should not touch the palm of your hand. As you lean in for your shot your right elbow should be bent to allow for full extension when carrying through your shot.\n\nYour left hand can hold the front end of the cue stick in one of two styles: the open bridge and the closed bridge. The open bridge is used mainly for shots over obstacles, such as a bank or another ball, as it allows for full extension of the fingers. A closed bridge would be used for straight shots closer to the player as it maintains a straighter line with the cue stick. In most cases these styles can be used interchangeably, so pick whichever you prefer.\n\nTo shoot open bridge, place your palm flat on the table. Next, bend your fingers towards your palm so that the angle from your fingertips to your knuckles is about 30 degrees. All of the bending should be from your knuckles so that your fingers and your hand form a triangle with the table. Lift your thumb up so that a “v” shape is formed between your thumb and your palm. The cue stick will rest in this “v”. To adjust the angle of shot, raise or lower your fingers accordingly. Closed bridge is formed by placing the cue in an open bridge and then forming an “o” shape with your pointer finger and the table over the cue. The cue stick should not touch the top of the pointer finger but can brush the sides.\n\nWith this in mind we can move on to controlling spin.\n\nStep 3\n\nA good billiards player will adjust the spin of their shot so that the cue ball will move to a desired location.\n\nDepending on where you hit the cue ball the spin of the ball will change accordingly. Hitting the top of the ball creates forward spin (topspin), causing the ball to continue moving forward after contacting another ball. Hitting the bottom of the ball created backward spin (backspin), causing the ball to move backwards after making contact with another ball. Hitting the center of the cue ball is considered a flat shot and will cause the cue ball to stop wherever it makes contact with another ball.\n\nNOTE: Angling the cue stick up or down prior to hitting will also cause spin, but too forceful of a backspin or flat shot from a high angle can cause the cue ball to jump up off of the table. If used properly this can be a very useful shot but if not can cause an off-of-table foul.\n\nWith this information in mind we can set up the game to start play.\n\nStep 4\n\nNine Ball is slightly different than most billiards games in the way that the rack is set up. Instead of the traditional triangle shape, the balls must be arranged in a diamond with its longer side following the length of the table. As with all traditional racks, the top (the point closest to the other side) must be aligned with the “foot spot”. This will either be marked with a small dot on the table or can be approximated as one quarter of the length of the table.\n\nIn the case of Nine Ball, the player must hit the balls on the table in ascending order, winning the game by pocketing the nine ball. Due to this rule, the 1 ball must always be placed at the top of the diamond closest to the player and the nine ball in the center. All other balls in play may be placed arbitrarily.\n\nA diamond rack is preferred for ease of use, however if only a triangle rack is available use the top two sides to align the top point of the diamond while using your hands to push up the bottom point.\n\nNOTE: The “tighter” you make the rack, or the closer you place the balls to each other, the more responsive your break will be. To make your setup as tight as possible lift the rack straight up without touching the balls in the diamond. Any shifting can cause a “loose rack”, which should be corrected prior to starting.\n\nAfter the rack is set up, it’s time to lag for break.\n\nStep 5\n\n“Lagging for break” is a way to determine who breaks, or starts the game.\n\nEach player will hit the cue ball down the length of the billiards table and bounce it off of the wall, or bank. Your goal is to put the cue ball as close to the bank closest to you without touching, and whoever does so wins the lag. If there is a tie or all players hit the bank, lagging for break is done again. To designate your cue ball’s position on your lag, place your finger on the side of the table until all turns have passed or someone has bettered your shot.\n\nWhen the winner is decided, they will break.\n\nStep 6\n\nBreaking the rack is one of the most important shots in the game, as it can determine an instant win or loss as well as sets initial placement of balls on the table.\n\nAs said before, you must hit the balls in ascending order, and breaking is no exception. If you hit any other ball before the one, miss all of the balls entirely, or sink the cue ball in the pocket on the break it is considered a foul, or scratch, and you lose the game. Therefore it is considered best practice to place the cue ball closest to the center width of the table as it sets a straight line to the 1 ball in the rack.\n\nThere are restrictions on ball placement, however. You may not place the cue ball further than one quarter down the length of the pool table. This, just like racking, will either be designated by a dot on the table known as the “head spot” or two markers down the side of the table. Anywhere within this boundary is allowed, however it is recommended to place the cue ball as close to the edge as possible for the easiest shot.\n\nFor hitting the cue ball, a hard topspin is recommended however a flat shot will work just as well. A harder shot will disperse the balls more evenly across the table, which makes later shots easier during the game. As long as one ball touches a bank the break is considered fair, however, so if you want to set up a more difficult game for your opponent hit with a moderate backspin.\n\nIf a ball is pocketed on the break you may continue hitting. If the nine ball is sunk on the break you have won.\n\nAnd there you have it! Now that you know how to break you can start Nine Ball with more skill and strategy.

The tiny, metal atomizer had to be removed and I ended up breaking it off. Fortunately the edge wasn't too jagged so I wet sanded the edges.

In the meantime, prepare your wick by cutting it to length. When the oil is melted, dip the wick in and then squeeze out the excess.\n\nSet the wick aside and carefully pour the liquid coconut oil into your lamp container.

  {title: "Flores Con Filtros De Café", body: "Step 1\n\nLo primero es doblar los filtros de papel 4 veces. Necesitamos 5 piezas por cada flor que queramos crear. Luego con la tijera cortamos 3 de las 5 piezas por lo menos media pulgada en la parte superior.\n\nStep 2\n\nPara darle color a los pétalos, utilizaremos pintura diluida en agua. Podemos utilizar la pintura que queramos siempre y cuando se pueda diluir.

Al momento de separar, pondremos los triángulos mas pequeños en los colores más intensos y los restantes en los tonos más claros.\n\nStep 3\n\nEsperamos que las piezas sequen para proceder a cortarlas en las formas que deseemos.

  {title: "Make a Clipper-Card into a Critter", body: "Step 1: Soak the clipper card\n\nThe NFC chip is removed by soaking the clipper card in acetone (which is the main ingredient in nail polish remover). The oyster card tutorial I mentioned in step 1 says to soak overnight, but I have found a WEEK of soaking works best. I've not taken apart many cards, some work better than others. When it has been soaked enough, the chip (see image) will become free and be easy to remove. Carefully peel out the chip and antenna when it is loose enough to do so.\n\nIf a week is not long enough, simply leave it some more and check back every couple of days.\n\nWarning: despite it being such an easy to buy product (and the fact that we wipe our hands with it regularly) acetone is nasty stuff, make sure you have a lid on the container, and store it somewhere out of reach when you are soaking.\n\nStep 2: Sew the cuff\n\nI made a cuff by cutting out two organic looking shapes, and sewing them face to face, leaving a little gap to put filling in later. I then turned the cuff inside out to make it the correct orientation. I added little magnets to each \"leg\" to give the effect the Critter is clinging on. And finally stuffed with filling and sewed up the hole by hand.\n\nStep 3: Make an eye\n\nI decided to make an eye using I would not recommend doing this -I would buy a ready made button or glass gem as making it was hard and added a long time to the process. If you are interested though I made the eye by shaping and baking a putty silicon mold, and then cast it in resin using Easy Cast.\n\nStep 4: Solder half of the chip \n\nMeasure out a long length of conductive thread. Solder half the chip to one end of the conductive thread, as you will solder the other half when you have finished sewing.\n\nStep 5: Sew the antenna\n\nThis is the fun bit!\n\nYou are making a coil with the conductive thread, which is not insulated and so each layer of the coil needs to be separate. To sew the coil I used a method called couching, which was a technique used to sew gold thread into in medieval tapestries. You are not actually sewing with the conducive thread, you lay the thread on the surface of the fabric, and use a second thread to attach it.\n\nStep 6: Solder the other half\n\nAt the end of your coil you will ind up on the other side of the \"face\" to the NFC chip. To get the conductive thread to be next to the chip (without coming into contact with the coil), thread it through the cuff, under the coil. Then very carefully solder the end of the conductive thread to the chip. I left the thread long whilst I soldered, then trimmed it down after.\n\nStep 7: Add the eye\n\nOh the eye! (my not so favorite bit to make!) I glued the eye on over the chip in layers and added some \"eyelash\" stitches after.\n\nStep 8: Get your coat and go into town\n\nOh the places you'll go!", user_id: 29, images: "http://res.cloudinary.com/doilr7vvv/image/upload/v1473032678/ikbv2xyejxfrhwhsaymp.jpg", video_url: "https://vimeo.com/143306005", description: "Clipper is the card system used to make contactless payments on public transport in the Bay Area, CA.

  {title: "Rainbow Roller", body: "Step 1: Slicing Acrylic\n\nI had a large sheet of 2mm acrylic lying about. I decided to use it for this project but I later came to realize that gluing 2mm acrylic at 90 degrees is a royal pain. That's why you'll notice streaks of dried super glue all around the acrylic box I made. So go with 3mm acrylic if you have the option.\n\nI always cut my own acrylic but since there were so many pieces, I decided to use the help of a local shop with access to a table saw. The measurements of pieces required followed by quantity:\n\n17cm x 4.5cm - x2\n2cm x 4.5cm -x11\n11cm x 4.5cm -x1\n7cm x 2.5cm -x1 (this is mistakenly represented by a smaller piece in the image)\n\nStep 2: Making The Color Slot Box\n\nDivide the 2 17cm x 4.5cm pieces lengthwise into 1.6cm segments with a marker. There will be an extra 1cm left at the end which is for spacing. Glue the 11 2cm x 4.5cm pieces vertically at the markings. Finally glue the other side over it to complete the color slot box.\n\nAlso glue the 11cmx4.5cm piece at right angle to the box at the side with the 1cm spacing. Look at the finished product images to get an idea of the location at which it is to be glued.\n\nStep 3: Cut And Attach Absorptive Sponge\n\nCut the absorptive sponge into 16cm x 3cm rectangle. Cut out about 5mm slits into one side every 1.6cm. Insert it into the slot aligning it with the slits you just made. Use super glue to stick it the acrylic permanently. This sponge will transport the paints to the roller.\n\nStep 4: Cut and shape non-absorptive sponge\n\nMark the length of sponge required. Keep it about a centimeter extra so it should be around 17cm. Keep the width about 3cm and round off one side with cutter or scissors. This rounded edge will be used to keep the absorptive sponge in position so it doesn't bend too much. I had planned on using this sponge to transfer the paint to the roller with direct contact but it turned out to be non-absorptive and friction between roller and this sponge was too much.\n\nNow mark out 9 cuts of about 1cm at equal distance along its length. These will be pushed into the slots of the box and prevent the paint from draining out at once. Keep the absorptive sponge visible from the other side as they need to be in contact with the paint. You will have to squeeze them into the slots and this will keep the paint from draining any other way than through the absorptive sponge.\n\nStep 5: File The Roller Handle\n\nPick up a file and flatten both sides of the handle just before the 90 degree bend. This will allow the acrylic vice we will be making in the next step to hold on tightly.\n\nStep: 6 Roller And Box Meet At Last\n\nHeat bend the 7cm x 2.5cm acylic piece so it takes the shape as shown in the first image. The bend should be slightly smaller than the thichness of handle. Glue it to the bigger acrylic piece.\n\nAs shown in the second image, mark where the 90 degree turn comes and file a notch in the acrylic piece we just heat bent. This will ensure the handle doesn't move from side to side.\n\nNow place the handle between the 2 pieces of acrylic which is kind of the primitive vice we've made. Make sure the filed sides of the handle in the previous step makes the handle sit flat against the 2 acrylic pieces it is sandwiched between. Also the 90 degree bend should fit in the notch you've filed.\n\nNow I wanted to drill a hole at the end of the acrylic and press the handle between the 2 pieces but tightening a nut and bolt but I had no drill available so used sellotape which worked out just fine to press them together tightly.\n\nAs shown in 2nd and 3rd image, cut off the corner of the acrylic piece so it does not hit the surface when using the roller.\n\nStep 7: Support At The Other Side\n\nTake a metal rod piece of about 10-15cm and bend it into a right angle. I used a short piece cut from a clothes hanger. File the inner side of one arm flat so that when the other arm is inserted into the end of the roller opposite to the handle, the flattened part sits flat on the side of the acrylic box. Apply super glue to the metal rod and acrylic box side to glue them together. This will provide support at the opposite end of the box and keep it from twisting about.\n\nNotice that the absorptive sponge is like a curtain in front by default but as soon as the roller starts being pulled, it gets pulled in. To keep it from bending too much and make good contact with the roller, the curved part of the non-absorptive sponge plays an important role.\n\nStep 8: Fill In Acrylic Paints: Success!\n\nAcrylic paints when wet, can be somewhat mixed with water to dilute them. This lets the absorptive sponge absorb the color and pass it on to the roller. The roller then delivers the color to your canvas and spits forth mighty rainbows! The colors blend together beautifully and provides a great looking rainbow.\n\nYou will have to experiment with the amount to water to paint ratio. Usually 2 parts water and 1 part paint worked good. Prepare the paints in separate cups(I used chocolate box plastic cut into tiny cups) and keep them ready. Start pouring them into the slots in order and keep it over a sink or a newspaper as it will drip initially while you are busy pouring. Take a newspaper and start rolling the roller on the same area over and over again till the roller gets uniformly coated with color. Anytime the roller starts getting dry, pour a bit of water into the slot and it will get running again.\n\nNow go convert this dull world into something more colorful: build giant rainbows on your walls, convert the gray pavements into a rainbow path, rainbow colored tree trunks... you get the point.", user_id: 30, images: "http://res.cloudinary.com/doilr7vvv/image/upload/v1473033435/l2akcxmkznhaxovwnjbi.jpg", video_url: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqBQau56DkY", description: "A roller that paints rainbows!!!\n\nKids love painting instant rainbow and if you're a supporter of LGBT rights, show your appreciation by coloring this drab world with the pride rainbow.

  {title: "Homebrew Root Beer!", body: "Step 1: Establish Roots\n\nIn the days before you could buy bottled root beer extract in just about any grocery store in America, the typical root beer recipe started by steeping sassafras root the primary source for the flavor that we recognize in root beer in hot water, then adding sugar and yeast, and allowing the mixture to ferment in bottles. To further enhance the flavor of the beer, additional root barks and twigs such as sarsaparilla, burdock, and birch were also added. While foraging in the woods for these ingredients was once standard practice and still not uncommon even today, I was happy to discover that I could instead find them neatly packaged and ready to use at my local home brew store.\n\nStep 2: Get Aromatic\n\nOver time other aromatics were added to the brew pot to enhance the flavor of the root beer. Searching through various sources, it was not uncommon to find recipes calling for ingredients like licorice, vanilla, mint, ginger, citrus zest, cinnamon and the like. For my recipe I wanted to incorporate some of the traditional roots with a few interesting aromatics without creating a laundry list of ingredients that was a hassle to gather.\n\nStep 3: Water It\n\nI decided to base my recipe off of 1 gallon of water, which was enough to keep my refrigerator stocked for a while and could be easily handled in a small kitchen I’d leave the multi-gallon batches to the professionals. I preferred to use filtered water because my tap water at home was pretty metallic tasting.\n\nStep 4: Steep It\n\nWith 2 quarts of water in my saucepan, I then added my roots I chose a combination of sassafras and sarsaparilla along with some spearmint, star anise, ginger, and cinnamon for spice, and a vanilla bean for fragrance. After bringing the mixture to a boil, I covered the pot and allowed everything to steep for about 2 hours.\n\nStep 5: Sanitize It\n\nWith the root beer mixture off to the side, it was now time to start sanitizing my bottles and equipment. While homemade beverages are a highly unlikely source of food poisoning, any bacteria that do make it into a batch of homemade root beer can cause sour off-tastes and ruin the batch. For some, like my dad whose is a chemist by trade, the brewing area can imitate laboratory settings; for others, simply dunking their equipment in soapy water is sufficient. I tried to aim for the middle of the road. I washed all of my equipment in hot soapy water and then did my best to sanitize everything as well most importantly the bottles. I found that a simple 2-minute soak in a bleach solution (1 tablespoon of unscented chlorine bleach for every gallon of hot water) did the trick. Make sure to drain everything well, for at least 30 minutes.\n\nStep 6: Strain It\n\nAfter 2 hours of steeping, the root beer mixture was ready to strain. At this point the liquid was more of a concentrate so I added the remaining 2 quarts of water to dilute the mixture along with the sugar. I could have started with all of the water in the beginning, but I found that adding half of the water at this stage helped to cool down the mixture quicker, which was necessary before adding the yeast. Granulated sugar would have worked just fine, but I tested several versions of this recipe with different types of sweeteners and found a combination of 1½ cups brown sugar and ½ cup molasses was best. The darker color of these two ingredients also helped to achieve the signature look for the root beer.\n\nStep 7: Cool It\n\nBefore adding the yeast, I cooled the root beer mixture further to around 75 degrees. If the mixture was too hot, there was a chance that the yeast would die. Most recipes I found recommended ale yeast because it did not impart any flavors, though I also read recipes that called for regular active dry yeast. Since I was already at the home brew store to pick up my sassafras and sarsaparilla, grabbing some ale yeast was convenient and what I used in my recipe, though I am sure traditional yeast would have worked as well. Once I added the yeast, I allowed 15 minutes for proofing before I began bottling.\n\nStep 8: Bottle It\n\nThere are several tools out there for bottling batches of home-brewed beverages. However, I found that for a small batch like this, the easiest way to bottle was with a funnel and a ladle. I simply lined the bottles up, placed the funnel on top of the bottles, and ladled in the root beer mixture. I preferred 22-ounce glass bottles, though 1-litre plastic soda bottles and smaller glass bottles would work as well. To avoid any exploding bottles, I filled the bottles to within 2 inches of the top, leaving adequate room as pressure built up in the bottles.\n\nStep 9: Cap It\n\nDepending on the types of bottles used, the capping procedure can change. For my glass bottles, I placed a metal cap on top of each bottle and secured it with a bottle capper. Once capped, the bottles needed to sit at room temperature (ideally 62 to 77 degrees) so that the yeast could begin to eat the sugars and carbonate the root beer. The carbonation time depends on the type of yeast used and the temperature of the room, though in general it takes between 36 and 72 hours. I found that 48 hours was an appropriate amount of time for my root beer, which was sitting in a 75-degree room. To check carbonation, I just opened a bottle and poured a glass.\n\nStep 10: Chill It\n\nOnce the carbonation was right, I placed all the bottles into the refrigerator and waited a couple days for the flavors to meld. Refrigerating the bottles also caused the yeast to go dormant, which restricted the production of carbon dioxide even with the 2-inch gap I provided, too much carbonation would still cause bottles to blow.\n\nStep 11: Fizz It!\n\nWan't to make it fizz? Sodastream is a great carbonating machine.\n\nStep 12: Drink It\n\nThe end result was a huge success. The root beer was full of unique spice and rich flavor—everything I was looking for. Most recipes I found recommend drinking the root beer within 5 weeks for the best results, but my first batch only lasted 5 days.

Most of the time his brew pot was full of brown ale or chocolate stout, but occasionally he would pull the step stool up to the counter and we would brew a batch of homemade root beer together. He kept the recipe short and simple (much like my attention span at the time) by working with a bottle of root beer extract and a basic brewing method combine the proper proportions of water, sugar, extract and yeast; bottle; and ferment. This was a far cry from many of his beer recipes, which took the better part of a day to make, but the resulting root beer did the trick for my youthful palate it was my absolute favorite drink.", material: "I will mention them as I go.

  {title: "Braided Buns", body: "Step 1: Hair Parting\n\nStart by brushing out your hair to make sure that it is smooth. I know mine doesn't look combed out, but trust me, it is. Make a part down the middle all the way down your head. It doesn't have to be perfect, as you can clearly see mine is not. Use either the large clip or a ponytail holder to hold one of the sections out of the way.\n\nStep 2: Making the Ponytails\n\nTaking one of the large ponytail holders, bring one section of your hair into a ponytail near the top of your head, or where you want your buns to be placed. You can choose to do these on the side or the back of your head, as well. Repeat to the other side, making sure that they look like they have been reflected over the middle hair part. Again, this doesn't have to be perfect.\n\nStep 3: Braiding Your Hair\n\nTake one of the ponytails, and divide it into three sections. Start braiding your hair all the way down, and then securing it with a small elastic. You can just do a regular braid. or you can get creative and do a fishtail, or even a rope twist. Repeat the braid to the other side, and secure with an elastic. You can choose to pancake (pull out the edges of the braid to make it look larger) the braid if you wish, but, as you can see, I have enough hair.\n\nStep 4: Forming the Buns\n\nTake the end of one of the braids, and wrap them around to form a bun shape. Make sure you like the way it sits, and then secure with bobby pins. Repeat to the other side. You can even add in a bow, if you wish, like I did.\n\nStep 6: Final Look\n\nAnd that is how you make the Braided Buns! Thank you so much for reading, and I hope you enjoyed this tutorial! Be sure to let me know if you try out this hairstyle.\n\nEnjoy!", user_id: 32, images: "http://res.cloudinary.com/doilr7vvv/image/upload/v1473035259/ms0zlxokxkltxuyeusbd.jpg", video_url: "", description: "This is an easy, quick hairstyle that looks pretty and keeps the hair out of your face!
